Hello, my name is Patrick and I am a mechanical / mechatronic engineering graduate. 

I have a passion for engineering design, particularly relating to robotics. Most of my programming experience has therefore come from my engineering projects,
such as MATLAB and C++ programming.

If you'd like to reach me, send me an email @ PatrickDowe@gmail.com
